 ![](https://github.com/houssston/find-film/blob/main/readme-image.gif)
Display collaboration movies with using API [here](https://houssston.github.io/searchCollaborations/)  
Share your search using URL(URLSearchParams).

In this project I mastered:
 - React
 - react-create-app 
 - redux, redux-thunk, react-redux 
 - react-router
 - axios 
 
 All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
  - clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/houssston/find-film.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
  - `cd find-film`
  - `npm install` 
  - `npm start`
